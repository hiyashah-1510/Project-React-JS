# 📘 Project Description — React Explorer

React Explorer is an interactive learning application built using React.
The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate all the core concepts of React through small, simple, real-time examples. It helps beginners understand how React works by showing JSX, Components, Props, State, Events, Lists, Forms, useEffect, and Class Components in an easy and practical way.

The project contains multiple modules, where each module focuses on one React concept.
The user can click buttons to switch between modules, and each module instantly updates on the screen because of React's rendering and component-based structure.

Everything in this project is done using React only — no backend, no database, no external storage.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

    -> To demonstrate how React builds UI using JSX

    -> To show how functional and class components work

    -> To explain the difference between props and state

    -> To show real-time UI updates using useState

    -> To practice event handling like clicks and input changes

    -> To render and filter lists using map() and keys

    -> To build controlled forms using React state

    -> To visualize lifecycle behavior using useEffect

    -> To show class component lifecycle methods

    -> To organize code using a modular component structure

# 🧩 Project Features
✔ 1. JSX Module

Shows how JSX works, including expressions, attributes, and nested elements.

✔ 2. Props Module

Demonstrates passing data from parent to child components.

✔ 3. State Module

Shows how useState updates data instantly (e.g., counter example).

✔ 4. Events Module

Demonstrates event handling like button clicks and input events.

✔ 5. List Rendering Module

Displays arrays using map(), uses unique keys, and includes a search filter.

✔ 6. Form Module

Shows how to create controlled forms where input is managed by React state.

✔ 7. useEffect Module

Explains component mounting, updating, and unmounting with simple side effects (like a timer).

✔ 8. Class Component Module

Shows basic class component structure, state, and lifecycle methods.
